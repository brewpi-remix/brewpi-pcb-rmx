Before we proceed, a huge thank you to [Elco Jacobs](https://github.com/elcojacobs), without whom none of this would be possible.  Additionally, thank you to [@day_tripper](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/members/day_trippr.81618/) whose design for the LCD shield was the first user-sourced solution for these boards, and to [@Cadibrewer](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/members/cadibrewer.149782/) who carried the flag and created the shield versions many people use today.

This repository contains the PCB files for [BrewPi Remix](https://www.brewpiremix.com) which runs on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), communicating with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction).  

These [forks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) are intended for the users of [BrewPi Remix](https://www.brewpiremix.com), an updated version of the original [BrewPi Legacy](https://github.com/BrewPi) branches.  For current [BrewPi Spark 3](https://www.brewpi.com/) information and support, please continue to use and support [the original project](https://github.com/BrewPi).

## Modifying These Files

If you would like to personalize these board designs, you may modify them with [Autodesk's EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview). EAGLE is a scriptable electronic design automation (EDA) application with schematic capture, printed circuit board (PCB) layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) features. EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor and is developed by CadSoft Computer GmbH. The company was acquired by Autodesk Inc. in 2016.  

The program supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.  EAGLE is available in a [free version](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download), as well as a [subscription-based version with more features](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/compare).

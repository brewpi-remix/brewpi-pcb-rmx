# BrewPi Remix Printed Circuit Board Eagle Files
This repository contains the Eagle files for printed circuit boards supporting [BrewPi Remix](https://www.brewpi.com/this-is-brewpi-0-2/).

Before we proceed, a huge thank you to [Elco Jacobs](https://github.com/elcojacobs), without whom none of this would be possible. Also, these circuit boards were originally inspired by the work of [@day_trippr](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/members/day_trippr.81618/) on [Homebrewtalk.com](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/how-to-brewpi-lcd-add-on.510036/), and originally released by [@Cadibrewer](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/members/cadibrewer.149782/).

## Boards Provided
Within this repository are:

- Arduino shield supporting BrewPi Remix RevC as well as I2C
- Rotary Encoder breakout to facilitate connecting the rotary encoder with DuPont wires
- Shield breakout providing all possible connections via screw terminals as well as DuPont connections, plus heat/cool LED indicators

## Modifying These Files
If you would like to personalize these board designs, you may modify them with [Autodesk's EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview). EAGLE is a scriptable electronic design automation (EDA) application with schematic capture, printed circuit board (PCB) layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) features. EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor and is developed by CadSoft Computer GmbH. The company was acquired by Autodesk Inc. in 2016.  

The program supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.  EAGLE is available in a [free version](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download), as well as a [subscription-based version with more features](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/compare).

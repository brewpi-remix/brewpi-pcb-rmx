Make or buy?  That is the question.  Since providing the below listed DIY breakout, I found these on Amazon (of course!):

- [Four-Way RJ45 Breakout Board](https://smile.amazon.com/Electronics-Salon-4-Way-Breakout-Terminal-Connector/dp/B01GNOBDPM)
- [RJ45 Ethernet Splitter (2-way)](https://smile.amazon.com/Splitter-Connectors-Ethernet-Interface-Internet/dp/B07CW7JHYV)
- [RJ45 Ethernet Splitter (3-way)](https://smile.amazon.com/Ethernet-Splitter-vienon-Adapter-Connector/dp/B0932B8JGJ)

I have the below setup in all my fermenters, but I have to say I might be tempted to use these if I had to do it again.

If you are at a loss to pick a charity, may I suggest the [Wounded Warrior Project](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/)?

If you are interested in building a splitter, here's one way to go:

# Rotary Encoder Breakout v1.3.1a

A breakout board to provide pins for connecting the rotary encoder to the BrewPi controller.  Designed for CUI, [ACZ11BR1E-15FD1-20C](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/490-CZ11BR1E15FD120C) or similar footprint.  Despite the picture linked on that page, you want a vertical mounting encoder (and that one really is.)  You don't really *need* this, but it will surely make it easier to connect things with Dupont wires.
